## Project Description

This project was an attempt to create a chat application that allows user to authenticate through Google/Facebook Sign In and initiate chat with other users who are available at the time. One user should only be able to chat with one user at the time, when doing so, their statuses were displayed as busy. If the user was not chatting with anyone, his or her status was displayed as online, which allows them to initiate chat with other users who are also online or get invited into a chatroom with user who selected them.

Upon completing, the project should be deployed on Firebase server
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development Progress

The basic function of the application are ready, however, the Facebook Login, Sign Out Function, and Emoji Board were disable due to lack of time.
The deployment to firebase was attempted but not successful at the time

## To-do

- Fix bugs
- Re-enable Facebook Login, cookies, log out function
